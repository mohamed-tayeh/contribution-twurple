A set of libraries that aims to cover all of the existing Twitch APIs.

- Query the Helix API
- Build a chat bot
- React to custom redemptions, subscriptions, follows and much more using PubSub and EventSub
- Do all this without caring about the expiry of your access tokens - **we can refresh them automatically**

## Installation

To add Twurple to your project, just execute:

	yarn add @twurple/auth

or using npm:

	npm install @twurple/auth

## Documentation

A good place to start with this library is the [documentation](https://twurple.js.org)
which also includes a complete reference of all classes and interfaces, as well as changes and deprecations between major versions.

## Additional packages

The mentioned `@twurple/auth` package only provides authentication functionality. All the other things are located in separate packages:

- [@twurple/api](https://npmjs.com/package/@twurple/api) - make calls to the Helix API
- [@twurple/chat](https://npmjs.com/package/@twurple/chat) - connect to and interact with Twitch Chat
- [@twurple/pubsub](https://npmjs.com/package/@twurple/pubsub) - listen to events using the Twitch PubSub interface
- [@twurple/eventsub-http](https://npmjs.com/package/@twurple/eventsub-http) - listen to events using EventSub over HTTP/WebHooks
- [@twurple/eventsub-ws](https://npmjs.com/package/@twurple/eventsub-ws) - listen to events using EventSub over WebSockets
